Here's a look at the plane I built called the Ansley Peace Drone. I got the design for this plane from Ed at Experimental Airlines. He has some great designs and building styles that all use the dollar store foam and I would highly recommend checking his Youtube channel out for more information. My primary reason for building this was to get a cheap, stable, and efficient FPV platform. It only uses 4 sheets of foamboard and I can easily get 30+ minutes of flight time with the 2 x 2200mAh batteries.

Here's a list of parts that I used:
- Dt850 Outrunner Motor
- Hobbyking 30A ESC
- 2 x Turnigy 9g servo
- 2 x Turnigy 20C 2200mAh Lipo (in parallel)
- APC 12x6 prop
- Hobbyking multirotor controller board v2.1 (optional)

This is how the wing attaches to the fuselage

This is the 3D printed camera mount I designed for my Fatshark Predator v2's

Here's the rear hatch which holds the stabilization board and receiver

This is the connection between the large wing and the fuselage

Here you see the bottom of the plane with the HK 30A ESC mounted for proper cooling

This motor mount is just an L bracket with some break away zip ties for rough landings

To sum it all up this plane flies absolutely great! The dt850 motor is more than powerful enough to push this plane along. I rarely need to exceed 1/2 throttle! Though the stabilization board is nice to have, I hardly ever use it because the plane is already so stable and smooth. It's nice to have when you fumble around trying to pull down FPV goggles though. Maybe I'll write an article on how to use this hobbyking board with a plane; it was a bit tricky to get right. Launching the plane can be somewhat difficult because of the 12" propeller in the back. What works for me is throwing it hard into the air with no power on so that it glides, and then giving it some throttle to power away from the ground. I found that the CG is best at 1/2 the length of the fuselage but performance isn't effected much if it's not exactly there. This is by far one of my best flying planes and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an FPV platform.
