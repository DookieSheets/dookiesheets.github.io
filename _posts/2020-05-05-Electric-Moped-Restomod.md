I Wanted to share some pictures from my college moped restoration project. Basically, I took a junk 1977 Batavus HS50 and added an electric motor and recycled 18650 battery. Here are a few photos from the original Facebook Marketplace listing:

Here's some shots of the initial rebuild and motor configuration. The dual-outrunner setup ultimately worked but was geared too tall and lacked startup torque.

Some photos from the battery making process. 3D printed interlocking cell holders and spot-welded individual cell fuses.

Final motor setup with 3D printed drive pulleys and motor mount adapter.

All in all this was a very fun college project. I learned a lot about the process of repurposing used 18650 cells and I pushed the mechanical limits of 3D printed plastic parts.
